I spent most of today and last night refactoring a form based ontop of the curses library. 
It feels like an uphill battle - but I can see the overall efficiency gains closer to the end of the project. 
- textboxes are working and user input: the return button can change user views by firstly destroying our view and then reinstantiating a different one.
